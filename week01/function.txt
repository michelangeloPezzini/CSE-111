#There are 4 types of functions
1. Built-in functions
  -You donÂ´t need to import any module to use them.
  exemples: input, int, float, str, len, range, abs, round, list, dict, open, and print.

  #To call a function you must know the following three things:
  1.The name of the function
  2.The parameters that the function takes
  3.What the function does

  exemple 01:
  name = input("Enter your name")
  parameter = (prompt)
  argument = ("String")

  exemple 02:
  def soma(num1, num2){
    result = num1m + num2
    print(result)
  }
  soma(5,4)

  *A parameter is a piece of data that a function need to complete the task (num1, num2).
  *An argument is the value that the user will give when the function be called (5,4).

2. Standart library functions

  Here you have to import modules that have a collection of related function.
  exemple: 
  import math
  math.srqt(x)

  From this short description, we know the following:
  1.The name of the containing module is math.
  2.The name of the function is sqrt.
  3.The function takes one parameter named x.
  4.The function computes and returns the square root of the number that is in x.


3. Third-party functions

4. User-defined functions
